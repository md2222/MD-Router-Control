MD Router Control

Opens your router's web interface by one click on the tray icon. The password is stored in gnome keyring. After closing the interface window, checks connection to the test address and changes tray icon color.
Based on webkit2gtk.

Install

Change the current working directory to ".../src". Do "make" to compile the program. Do "make install" to install the program. 
Do "make uninstall" to uninstall the program.

This method is not suitable for all systems. I recommend looking at the actions in the Makefile.
